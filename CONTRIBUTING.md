## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions! Follow these guidelines to ensure a smooth collaboration:

1. **Create a Branch / Fork**  
Always work on a separate branch / fork instead of committing directly to the `master` branch. GitHub will require you to create a pull request (PR) to merge your changes.


2. **Setup your development environment**  
[Setup Instructions](https://github.com/LegitiDevs/bot/blob/master/SETUP.md)


3. **Start coding!**  
Always test changes locally before creating a pull request. Be descriptive and precise in your commit messages.


4. **Review Guidelines**
- Follow coding standards outlined in the repository (if available).
- Test your changes locally before submitting a PR.
- Be open to feedback and ready to make necessary adjustments.
